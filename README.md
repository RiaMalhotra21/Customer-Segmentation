# Customer-Segmentation
In this project, K-Means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, is applied to group customers based on two key features: annual income and spending score. The goal is to create meaningful customer clusters that can be analyzed for targeted marketing, improving customer engagement, and optimizing services.
